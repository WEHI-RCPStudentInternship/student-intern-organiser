        <p>1. This is a 100% remote internship. This means all meetings are virtual. Are you OK with this?</p>
        <p>2. We take Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seriously. We have a Code of Conduct that you have to abide by that is in the WEHI RCP Student Internship Handbook on page 10. Have you read it and are you willing to abide by it?</p>
        <p>3. Are you a talker or are you more of a listener? The reason I ask is because I don't want a team of all listeners I need at least one talker.</p>
        <p>4. Are you more of a facilitator or a follower? The reason I ask is because I don't want a team full followers.</p>
        <p>5. And are you more of a person who's an intentional thinker where you will need to go away think about it and come back this I'm suggestions or are you more of a quick brainstorm who likes to throw ideas around and see what comes up?</p>
        <p>6. What projects are you interested in and why?</p>
        <p>7. I will then show you the projects that are currently still available based on your interests.</p>
        <p>8. I will then explain the next steps to you</p>
        <p>9. I will ask you if you have any other questions.</p>
